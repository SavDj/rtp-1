A complete, open-source UVM testbench for an 8-bit ALU.



This project implements a comprehensive UVM testbench for an 8-bit ALU that supports:



* 8 operations: ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR, NOT, SHIFT LEFT, ARITHMETIC SHIFT RIGHT
* Two operational modes: Single-cycle and 2-stage pipeline
* Handshake protocol



Verification Environment

* UVM-compliant architecture: Agent, sequencer, driver, monitor, scoreboard
* Constrained-random stimulus: Targeted test scenarios for each operation
* Automated checking: Reference model + scoreboard for result validation
